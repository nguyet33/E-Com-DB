SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API

THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database

## Description
As a developer, it's important to understand the e-commerce industry, which is conducted online and is the largest sector within the electronics industry, having generated an estimated US$29 trillion in 2017, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Various platforms such as Shopify and WooCommerce offer a suite of services to create e-commerce websites that cater to businesses of all sizes. As these platforms are widely used, it's essential for me to be familiar with the underlying architecture of e-commerce sites. In this challenge, I'm tasked with building the back end for an e-commerce site. I'll be given a working Express.js API, and my goal is to configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. This will require me to have a strong understanding of how to design and manage databases, as well as how to integrate them with an API built on top of the Express.js framework.


## My-Task
In this task, I will be working with a functional Express.js API and my goal is to complete a series of steps to configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. First, I will need to add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file to establish a connection with the database using Sequelize. Then, I will use schema and seed commands to create a development database that is seeded with test data. Once the development database is created, I will invoke the application command to start the server and sync my Sequelize models with the MySQL database. To ensure that everything is working correctly, I will test API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags to display the data in a formatted JSON. Finally, I will test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core to create, update, and delete data in the database. By completing these steps, I will successfully configure the Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database and will be able to perform various operations on the data.
